		<h2>Sleeping in a Treehouse</h2>

		
	
		<p>It was so high up that you’d have to snap your head as far back as it could go just to gaze up at the treehouse.</p>
		<p>I don’t remember we heard about it, it was probably from a post on social media. With rough directions, we went to find it. We marched through the afternoon with more gear than we could possibly need.</p>
		<p>The base of the tree was hidden past twenty minutes of steep trails.</p>
		<p>It looked impossible. There was no way we could climb something this tall – definitely not with our bags on. You had to squint to even seen the treehouse itself.</p>
		<p>I tried first. It was a strenuous climb on branches that were beginning to wear down. It felt like an eternity getting up there. Branch by branch, I hoisted myself up. At the top, a trapdoor was the final step before the safety and reassurance of the plywood platform.</p>
		<p>On it, there was a bench, coffee table, and other janky pieces. A swing swung right over the entire 80 foot drop. Every inch of the place was marked with doodles and quotes.</p>

		<p>I made use of a pulley and yanked our bags up.</p>
		<p>F took ages to climb and asked me to chat with him the whole time to distract himself from the unnerving height.</p>
		<p>We made a massive spread of food for dinner. The moon slipped through the few branches above us as we slept. In the morning, we had oatmeal.</p>
		<p>Only a few months later, police tore down the treehouse after some drunk kids fell from the thing.</p>
		<p>There’s lots of places like this in Santa Cruz. Abandoned or secret places where we can escape to. When we find them, we always make sure not to geotag them.</p>
		<p>A few remain hidden...</p>
